## pkgsrc-extra

This repository contains pkgsrc packages that are not suitable for upstream
pkgsrc.  They are primarily used by the SmartOS and illumos package sets
available from <https://pkgsrc.smartos.org/>.

Care should be taken to ensure only legitimate packages exist here.  In the
vast majority of cases it is better long-term to ensure packages are committed
upstream where possible.
