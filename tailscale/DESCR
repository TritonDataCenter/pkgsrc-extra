Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own
accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly.  It enables
encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol,
which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each
other.

Building on top of a secure network fabric, Tailscale offers speed, stability,
and simplicity over traditional VPNs.  Tailscale is fast and reliable.  Unlike
traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway
server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (called a tailnet):

The Tailscale approach avoids centralization where possible, resulting in both
higher throughput and lower latency as network traffic can flow directly
between machines.  Additionally, decentralization improves stability and
reliability by reducing single points of failure.

Tailscale is simple and effortless.  The service handles complex network
configuration on your behalf so that you don't have to.  Network connections
between devices pierce through firewalls and routers as if they weren't there,
allowing for direct connections without the need to manually configure port
forwarding.  It allows for connection migration so that existing connections
stay alive even when switching between different networks (e.g., wired,
cellular, Wi-Fi, etc).
